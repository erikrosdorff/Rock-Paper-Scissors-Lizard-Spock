# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock
Scissors cuts Paper, Paper covers Rock, Rock crushes Lizard, Lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes Scissors, Scissors decapitates Lizard, Lizard eats Paper, Paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes Rock, and as it always has, Rock crushes Scissors
Ideally, I would like to display the rule on how the person one for example the computer chose scissors and player chose lizard it would display "scissors decapitates lizard" you lost. Any advice would be great!
